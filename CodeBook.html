<p>##The Data:</p>

<p>The data are obtained here:</p>

<p><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a></p>

<p>The detailed explanation of the experiments is:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which can be found at <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#39;README.txt&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;features_info.txt&#39;: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;features.txt&#39;: List of all features.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;activity_labels.txt&#39;: Links the class labels with their activity name.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/X_train.txt&#39;: Training set.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/y_train.txt&#39;: Training labels.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;test/X_test.txt&#39;: Test set.</p></li>
<li><p>&#39;test/y_test.txt&#39;: Test labels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#39;train/subject_train.txt&#39;: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt&#39;: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units &#39;g&#39;. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the &#39;total_acc_x_train.txt&#39; and &#39;total_acc_z_train.txt&#39; files for the Y and Z axis. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt&#39;: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt&#39;: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>##The Variables:</p>

<p>For each record in the dataset it is provided: </p>

<ul>
<li>Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. </li>
<li>Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. </li>
<li>A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. </li>
<li>Its activity label. </li>
<li>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix &#39;t&#39; to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). </p>

<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the &#39;f&#39; to indicate frequency domain signals). </p>

<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br/>
&#39;-XYZ&#39; is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<p>tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag</p>

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: </p>

<p>mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.</p>

<p>Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:</p>

<p>gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean</p>

<p>The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in &#39;features.txt&#39;</p>

<p>##The Transformations:
Firstly, I merged (by column) for training data set the subject activity and the measured variables and for test data set, respectively.
Then, I merged by row the two &ldquo;merged&rdquo; data set in one &ldquo;alldata&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, which are the variables with labels:</p>

<pre><code>g &lt;- grep(&quot;-(mean|std)\\(\\)&quot;,names(train))
extracted_data &lt;- cbind(alldata[,1:2],alldata[ , g])
</code></pre>

<p>I added the descriptive activity names column to this data set and labelled the descriptive activity names according to &#39;activity_labels.txt&#39;. I added the subject column to this data set and calcaluted the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. I stored the means in a new tidy data set. Finally, I wrote this tidy data set to a text file.</p>
